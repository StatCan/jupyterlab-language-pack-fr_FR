This package is a complete version of the unfinished FR upstream [package](https://github.com/jupyterlab/language-packs/tree/master/jupyterlab/locale/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES). Until all translations are complete upstream for jupyterlab and it's [extensions](https://github.com/jupyterlab/language-packs/tree/master/extensions) that we pre-install in our images (git, lsp) please continue using this translation-pack as it is complete to our needs and current version of Jupyterlab. Upon upgrading Jupyterlab versions, there may be strings that will need to be added to this package.
